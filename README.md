# Connect4 with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)

This project is a C# implementation of the classic game **Connect4**, enhanced with an AI opponent using the **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm to make decisions. The difficulty of the AI can be adjusted by changing the number of MCTS iterations.

## Project Description

The game implements Connect4 on a 6x7 board using C# and Windows Forms. The player competes against the computer, whose moves are calculated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). The user can adjust the number of simulations per move, which effectively changes the AI's difficulty.

**Objective:** Be the first to connect 4 of your own discs either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

If the board is completely filled without any player connecting four discs, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Adjustable difficulty by changing the number of MCTS simulations.
- User-friendly Windows Forms interface.
- Randomized tie-breaks to avoid deterministic outcomes when multiple moves have the same evaluation.
- Ability to start a new game at any point.
- Visual cues for possible moves, player pieces, and computer pieces.
